# Natural-Language-Processing-for-Amazon-Alexa-Reviews
The dataset consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc. for learning how to train Machine for sentiment analysis.  We will use this data to analyze Amazon’s Alexa product ; discover insights into consumer reviews and assist with machine learning models. We will also train our machine models for sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews on how many positive or negative reviews there are about this product.

## Purpose

**Abstract :** This dataset consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc. for learning how to train Machine for sentiment analysis.

We will use this data to analyze Amazon’s Alexa product ; discover insights into consumer reviews and assist with machine learning models. We will also train our machine models for sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews on how many positive or negative reviews there are about this product.

**Aim** : To utilize Natural Language Processing to predict the user-given rating of a product, in this case Amazon Alexa in her various forms, based on the review text.


## Tools Utilized
These are the tools I have utilized for the following project:
* Google Colab
* Python

### Python Libraries 
* Natural Language Toolkit
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* RegEx
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* spaCy
* WordCloud

**TO RUN THE CODE, DOWNLOAD THE PYTHON FILE AND USE PyScripter, PyDev, PyCharm, Google Colab or any other tools supported to open the .ipynb file**
 
Used Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Guassian Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, Linear Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest,and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) to create predictive models and interpret them. Found a significant relation for each algorithm in the data to create multivariate models.

## Dataset Information

## Conclusion

We started with Reading the data for the Alexa Reviews, Describing the data for various measures, Visualizing some data, Analyzing some of the Reviews based on their lengths, Determining the most Frequently used words, Visualized a Wordcloud for the Reviews, Used Spacy, Used Random Forest algorithm to model the data and performed Cross Validation.
